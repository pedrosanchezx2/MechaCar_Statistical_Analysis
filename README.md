## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition



In order to make a quantificable study that can be used to compare numbers against competitos will include. 

Costing: Substantial criteria that can be used for forecasting and budgets.
Performance: Vehicles performance
Fuel economy: Among the consumers this is one of the most important thigs considered while taking the purchasing desicion makin.g 

Data will be tested by, performance vs fuel consumption, Cost vs fuel economy and cost vs performance. 

Null hypothesis is that  cost, performance and fuel economy are equal among the companies Alternaative htesis will include a different price. 


The data for the analysis will have a dependent variable that will be numerica and continous, oppsotite from the independent which will be categorical.The data will be tested using A/B Testing method
